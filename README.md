Supa-IRC
======= 

Supa-IRC is an CLI encrypted chat over TCP using RSA and AES (yes it should be TLS but lemme do my stuff). 

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) are text-based chat system for instant messaging. They are not used that much nowaday, but they still are good coding challenge or old dad jokes.

I know it's dumb, but I have to say it, it <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">is not</span></span></span></span></span>
safe for use, encryption can be f?cked up, so, don't trust this script as unbreakable and don't send nuclear code or any other confidential data over Supa-IRC. üòÅ
